    <h1>My side of the story</h1>


    <p class="post-meta">First posted <time datetime="2025-11">November 2025</time></p>

    <p>In roughly September of 2025 I was banned from Pretendo Network following some accusations made 
       against me by another member. This doc will only exist to show my side of the story and as my 
       statement for admins to consider unbanning me from the network
    </p>

    <p>Going to get this out of the way this is in NO WAY PRETENDO'S FAULT. They acted apon two seperate
        user reports in order to protect the community and their network. I do not blame them in any way and 
        anyone who attacks them is a fucking loser.
    </p>


    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h1>Part 1. The moments before pretendo's involvement</h1>
 <p>This incident as a whole involves both myself (Bryn) and the other user (Who goes online by Clark) and began 
    when Clark began spamming my social media with racial slurs. Which promptly escelated to nazi imagry being sent 
    to me via Instagram DMs and TikTok photo comments.</p>
    <p>I thought nothing of this because me and Clark have had an unstable friendship. So I just blocked him.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately Clark refused to accept that I have blocked him, and resorted to multiple harassing and attention
       seeking behaviors. Including but not limited to:
    </P>

        <ul>
      <li>Photoshopping my face onto several things</li>
      <li>Using my likeness on Viggle AI to make deepfake fart fetish porn of me</li>
      <li>Impersonated me using more than 50 tiktok accounts</li>
      <li>Purchased my old domains (dumbfoxfurry.xyz, dumbfoxfurry.gay) to impersonate and harass me further</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Things escelated when Clark decided to send me explicit content involving children, on an alt that I forgot
        to block, alongside sexually harassing multiple children to extort content from them.
    </p>

    <p>I made a comment about having clark's phone number and legal name and publicly threatened to send them to the
        FBI and local police (which I eventually did as his perverted behavior has continued) which is when he decided
        to attempt doxxing me, then played the victim claiming I am the harasser and doxxer.
    </p>

    <p>After blocking more of his accounts Clark began harassing me via Mutual servers, which is when I decided to
        contact Pretendo Network's Discord mods as a precaution.
    </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h1>Pretendo's involvement</h1>
<p>Pretendo mods got involved when I made a report about Clark's history of harassment and predatory behavior. As I was
    afraid of clark dragging things on within the server or using the mutual server in order to continue contacting me.
    I contacted mods out of concern for mine and the other member's safety.
    At the same time, clark contacted the mods claiming that I doxxed him. He played the victim card the whole way through
    despite being the instigator. As a result of the conflicting reports, Pretendo decided to permaban both of us from the
    discord server AND the network.
</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>My (admittedly poor) reaction the following morning</h1>
<p>As I woke up and used my local library's free wifi to access discord that morning is when I saw the message. Little information
   was given in the discord dm. I later logged in on my Wii U to my PNID completely banned. I admittedly did not take this well
   and ranted both within my discord server and tiktok accounts about how unfair the ban was. I didn't get the full story until After
   these posts. Which is when I found out he was also banned.
   The reason for this strong reaction was because I thought Clark got away with everything, and that back then I was reliant on playing
   Splatoon via the network in order to escape what I later found out was serious mental health issues.
   Alongside all this, I did not (and still don't) understand why it warranted a full-on pretendo-wide ban, rather than just a ban From
   the discord.
   I was not the one who doxxed clark, the entire ban was an understandable action based on the lack of information and resulting drama.
   I did not react the way I should've, I fully admit that. I'm sorry if I caused any unneeded stress to anyone at Pretendo.
   I'm hopeful by writing my full side of the story that we can finally clarify this mistake and we can finally put this incident behind us
   several months after the fact, and allow me to play online once again.
