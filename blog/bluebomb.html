    <p>
      Bluebomb is a known exploit in the Nintendo Wii's Bluetooth stack, allowing it
      to run unauthorized code. It is currently used as a method to fix the Banner
      Brick, and is the only known method of modding a Wii Mini.
    </p>

    <p>This guide will show you how to perform this exploit to launch the HackMii installer.</p>

    <h2>You will need:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A USB drive</li>
      <li>A computer with Bluetooth capabilities (or a compatible adapter)</li>
      <li>Ubuntu or a Live USB environment</li>
      <li>An Internet connection</li>
    </ul>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h1>Getting started...</h1>
    <p>If you havent already, install Ubuntu or a Ubuntu based Linux distro, if you do
       not want to install it on your computer you can boot from the installation media
       and select the option to try ubuntu without installing</p>

<p>
  You will also need to download the HackMii installer from 
  <a href="https://bootmii.org/download/" target="_blank">https://bootmii.org/download/</a>
  and unzip the contents of the zip file onto the root of a FAT32 formatted USB drive.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h1>Running the exploit</h1>
    <p>Copy the hackmii installer onto the root of your USB drive then plug it into USB port 0
       on your Wii (If your wii is on its side this will be the bottom port, If your wii is
        standing vertically itll be the port on the left)</p>
    <p>Boot into your Ubuntu installation and connect to the internet, then open the terminal 
      and enter the following commands: </p>

    <p>wget https://wii.guide/assets/files/bluebomb-helper.sh</p>
    <p>chmod +x bluebomb-helper.sh</p>
    <p>./bluebomb-helper.sh</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bluebomb will download some files so wait a bit</p>
<p>When its finished it will ask you some questions, follow the prompts to answer the 
  questions. After that the exploit will run. When it has finished you will get a prompt
to re-enable the bluetooth service. If bluebomb has failed to run (which it likely will
on the first try), select no and re-run the script</p>
<p>When the script prompts "waiting to accept", the script is looking for your Wii in wiimote
  pairing mode. Go to your Wii and press the sync button a handful of times, this is the red
   button located where the SD card slot is.</p>
<p>You will see the connection has succeeded once the script starts uploading the payload. Once
  complete, your Wii will display the bluebomb credits, before proceeding into the HackMii installer </p>
<p>Once you see the hackmii's scam warning message, you will know you're in! From there just go through
   the hackmii installer as you would any other exploit and install bootmii and the homebrew channel </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h1>Finishing touches</h1>
    <p>If you are modding your Wii using this method, you should just install hbc and you're
      good to go.</p>
    <p>Alternatively if you are using this to fix a Banner Brick, proceed to installing the
      Homebrew Channel and the HackMii installer will exit to the homebrew channel where you
      can fix whatever issue got you into this mess. You could also replace the files on your USB
      for the hackmii installer with any single tool that can help you.
