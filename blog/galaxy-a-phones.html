The phone every techtoker likes to shit on, the Galaxy A! The Galaxy A is a budget to midrange 
phone series made by Samsung and is known for their quote “manufactured e-waste”. Every "techtoker"
nowadays LOVE to shit on and destroy this phone for zero reason! Maybe it wouldn't be shitty if you
bought any of the midrangers you fucking dumbasses! Anyway I will be showing you my
personal experience with two A series phones to show you that they aren't bad for most use cases.

    <h1>My experience using the Galaxy A20</h1>
    <p>The galaxy A20 was released in 2019 and has 3GB RAM, A Exynos 7884 CPU and a 13mp camera…not 
       the best specs by today's standards but pretty decent back in 2019. On the latest version of
       the stock operating system (One UI 3 on Android 11) the phone can perform basic tasks such as
       calls, sms and basic social media apps, but on things such as mobile gaming it doesn’t work so well...
       now let’s bring custom roms into the picture</p>
    <p>Custom roms are by far the best way to breathe new life into old mobile phones! As seen by the Galaxy A20</p>
    <p>On a custom rom the phone runs flawlessly, I installed both Lineage OS 20 and Pixel Experience, both of them 
       run like a dream on this phone with minimal issues such as no volte (But that’s to be expected when custom 
       romming a Samsung phone). I tried some mobile gaming and it ran pretty damn good for a $150 phone. Roblox on
       Natural Disaster Survival ran okay albeit a bit choppy on some scenes. The latest version of Minecraft runs
       well without much configuration and other smaller games are a dream on this phone. I tried social media apps
       such as Tiktok and Discord, they run well. I think the only downside to this phone is the camera quality but 
       it’s really good for the price when you custom rom it</p>

    <h1>My experience using the Galaxy A32</h1>
    <p>Now for the more expensive side of the spectrum, the Galaxy A32! I personally have the 4G model so things may differ 
       on the 5G model (for better or worse, im not sure). The Galaxy A32 was released in 2021 and runs Android 13 on One UI 5. 
       It’s rocking 4-8gb ram, a Mediatek MT6769V/CU CPU and a 64mp camera. This is the phone that I use as my daily driver.</p>
    <p>I tried this phone on both stock and on a custom rom and to be honest I don’t see much of a difference in performance. 
       On the stock firmware the phone performs basic functions such as calls, SMS and social media apps PERFECTLY, I even played 
       games such as terraria and Minecraft on it and it performed great! A ton of my recent tiktoks were made on my galaxy A32 
       and although the camera quality isn't the best in third-party apps. I learned that using the stock camera app for all your
       filming can result in significantly better video quality.</p>
    <p>When I custom rommed the phone I had some issues, There weren’t many roms available for the device and the Lineage OS and 
       Pixel experience ports I found don’t run well or had major issues such as cellular issues or being unable to set a lock 
       screen password. So I recommend keeping it on stock for now until someone makes a decent custom rom</p>
    <p>NOTE: As of November 2025 some roms have been released for the A32, so this information may be out of date.</p>

<p>Techtokers are always quick to call entire phone brands that they dislike 'ewaste' because of one bad experience with a lower
    end model. If you are one of these techtokers, respectfully shut the fuck up.
