    <h1>Why you should AVOID third-party power supplies.</h1>


    <p class="post-meta">First posted <time datetime="2025-07">July 2025</time></p>

    <p>Hey all and welcome to another blog post, this blog post will go more in-depth on a tiktok I
       uploaded, so here goes.</p>

    <p>My Wii U’s power supply broke recently, some wired got frayed from wear & tear and so my 
       caregivers took it for “safety reasons”, I then ordered a new power supply from a local 
       game shop. I later learned that it was the same cord that was being sold on Aliexpress for $12 </p>

    <p>I got ripped off, I know. I decided to write this blog post to spread awareness on the dangers of 
        third-party power supplies, ESPECIALLY ones from Aliexpress, eBay, temu. Etc.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>


    <h1>Extremely prone to under/over volting</h1>
    <p>When I first bought the power supply, I noticed static on the Wii U’s video output; this 
        should’ve been the first warning. Two days after the power supply arrived, I wanted to 
        play Splatoon but noticed my Wii U gamepad got video: but not the TV. The video would 
        occasionally flash on-screen but the minute I load a game it goes out completely. I later 
        learned that this was happening because the power supply was already failing and as a result 
        was giving a dodgy amount of voltage to my Wii U.</p>

<h1>Low manufacturing quality</h1>
<p>Soon after finding out the cause of my video issue, I unplugged the power supply and inspected the exterior, 
    I immediately noticed how hollow the plastic shell sounded, almost as if there was nothing inside. When 
    pushing the bottom of the case the plastic began to flex, indicating this thing was made from hopelessly 
    weak plastic.</p>
<p>After seeing how hollow the plastic is, I wondered what was inside the case. So I decided to find out! 
    Everything was held together with two Philips-head screws and a few plastic clips. I broke the hopelessly 
    brittle plastic case in the process.</p>
<p>The pcb was extremely low-quality and wasn’t even secured inside the case! Containing a few cheap components 
    that would make a good housefire-starter. The poor quality pcb will cause issues with power regulation, 
    which could end up damaging your Wii U! </p>
<p>I’m not an electrician, but this is not something you should trust with your expensive video game system.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Obviously, you should not buy third-party power supplies, but where do we get a genuine replacement? It highly 
   depends on your system and whether the manufacturer still provides tech support for it. Older systems like the 
   Nintendo Wii are no longer supported, so your only hope would be to either salvage one from another console or 
   buy a used power supply from a second-hand website. If your system is still supported, you may be able to pick 
   up a genuine replacement from the manufacturer’s website, or a authorized retailer.</p>

<p>If you are in doubt: contact your manufacturer!</p>
